# 1st code:

'''Download first 5 text files (Shakespeareâ€™s plays) from the following URL using a python script: http://www.textfiles.com/etext/AUTHORS/SHAKESPEARE/
Store these in a separate folder.
(Find the 5 URLs pointing to .txt files in the above page using code. Do not manually put any URL other than the above mentioned one in the code.)
'''

'''
Steps:
Set the URL of the webpage containing the Shakespeare's plays text files.
Send a GET request to the URL and get the HTML content of the page.
Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and find all links on the page.
Iterate over all the links and check if they point to a text file (ends with '.txt').
If a link is pointing to a text file, append the link to a list of text file links.
Create a new directory 'shakespeare_texts' to store downloaded text files, if it does not already exist.
Set a counter to 1 to number the downloaded text files.
Iterate over the first 5 text file links in the list.
Build the complete URL for the text file by appending it to the base URL.
Send a GET request to the text file URL and get the content of the text file.
Build a unique filename for the text file by concatenating the counter and the text file name.
Create a new file in the 'shakespeare_texts' directory with the unique filename and write the text file content to it.
Increment the counter.
Print a success message indicating that the text file has been downloaded.
Repeat steps 10-14 for each of the first 5 text files in the list.

#EXAMPLE 4:
'''Find number of words spoken by each character in all the plays.'''

'''
Steps:
Import necessary libraries - os and re
Define a regular expression pattern using re.compile function.
a. The pattern should match lines starting with a capitalized word (a character's name) or a sequence of capitalized words (a character's title).
b. The pattern should capture the character's name or title in the first group.
c. The pattern should capture any text following the character's name or title up to the first empty line in the second group.
d. The pattern should use positive lookahead to ensure that the empty line is followed by another line starting with a capitalized word.
Define a directory where the text files to be processed are located.
Create two empty dictionaries to store the character names and their lines.
Iterate over each file in the directory using os.listdir function.
Check if the file has a .txt extension using the endswith method.
If the file is a text file, open it and read the data.
Use the re.findall function with the compiled pattern to extract all the character names and their lines from the file.
Iterate over each match in the result of re.findall.
Extract the character name and dialogue from the match.
If the character name already exists in the character_names dictionary, add the dialogue to the existing value in the character_lines dictionary.
If the character name does not exist in the character_names dictionary, add the character name to the dictionary with a value of 1 and add the dialogue to the character_lines dictionary.
Iterate over the character_lines dictionary and calculate the total number of words for each character's lines using the split method to split each line into words and the len function to count the number of words.
Print the character name and total number of words for each character.
